This website serves as headquarters for \textbf{BADM 372 Applied Analytics}.

Content here will be updated with any changes made during the semester, so if at any point you are told there was a change in the schedule or an assignment, you can come here to get the updated version.

Also, this website has benefited greatly from lots of free, readily available resources posted on the web and we leverage these extensively. I would encourage you to review these resources in your analytics journey. Some that we specifically use with great frequency are these (\textbf{and I say a loud THANK YOU to the authors!}):

\section{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}\label{course-objectives-and-learning-outcomes}}

This course is designed to introduce to data science. Students will apply statistical knowledge and techniques to both business and non-business contexts.

At the end of this course students should be able to:

By the end of the course, you will be able to\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  gain insight from data
\item
  gain insight from data, reproducibly
\item
  gain insight from data, reproducibly, using modern programming tools and techniques
\item
  gain insight from data, reproducibly and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques
\item
  gain insight from data, reproducibly (with literate programming and version control) and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques
\item
  communicate results effectively
\end{itemize}

This course will be focused on both understanding and applying key business analytical concepts. Although the text serves as a useful foundation for the concepts covered in the class, simple memorization of the material in the text will not be sufficient. Class participation, discussion, and application are critical.

Exams will cover assigned chapters in the textbook, other assigned readings, lectures, class exercises, class discussions, videos, and guest speakers.

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%
\section{Class Participation:}\label{class-participation}}

I will frequently give readings or assignments for you to complete prior to the next class meeting. I expect you to fully engage the material: answer questions, pose questions, provide insightful observations. Keep in mind that quality is an important component in ``participation.'' Periodic cold calls will take place. I will also put students in the ``hot seat'' on occasion. In these class sessions, I may select a random group of students to lead us in the discussion and debate. Because the selection of participants will not be announced until class begins, everyone will be expected to prepare for the discussion. Reading the assigned chapters and articles are the best way to prepare for the discussion. If you have concerns about being called on in class, please see me to discuss. The purpose of the ``hot seat'' is not to stress or embarrass students, but to encourage students to actively engage the material.

\hypertarget{phones}{%
\section{Phones}\label{phones}}

\textbf{Phones are not allowed to be used in class without the instructor's prior consent.} If you have a need of a phone during class please let me know before class. Unauthorized use of electronic devices may result in the lowering of the grade or dismissal from the class. \textbf{I mean this.}

\textbf{The phone thing? I mean this.}

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\section{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

You are expected to be regular and punctual in your class attendance. Students are responsible for all the material missed and homework assignments made. If class is missed, notes/homework should be obtained from another student. If I am more than 15 minutes late, class is considered cancelled. No more than 4 absences are allowed during a semester. Exceeding the absence policy may result in receiving an F for the course. The professors roll is the official roll and students not present when roll is taken will be counted as absent. If a student must miss an exam, she or he must work out an agreeable time with the instructor to take the test prior to the exam being given. If a student misses a test due to an emergency, the student must inform the instructor as soon as is possible. In special cases, the instructor may allow the student to take a make-up exam.

\hypertarget{accommodations}{%
\section{Accommodations}\label{accommodations}}

Presbyterian College is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all students with documented disabilities. If you are seeking academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you must register with the Academic Success Office, located on 5th Avenue (beside Campus Police). To receive these accommodations, please obtain the proper Accommodations Approval Form from that office, and then meet with me at the beginning of the semester to discuss how we may deliver your approved accommodations. I especially encourage you to meet with me well in advance of the actual accommodations being provided, as it may not be feasible to offer immediate accommodations without sufficient advance notice (such as in the case of tests). I can assure you that all discussions will remain confidential. Disability Services information is located at this link \url{http://bit.ly/PCdisabilityservices}

Additionally, it is the student's responsibility to give the instructor one week's notice prior to each instance where accommodation will be required.

\hypertarget{honor-code-and-plagiarism}{%
\section{Honor Code and Plagiarism:}\label{honor-code-and-plagiarism}}

All assignments/exams must be your own work. Any copying or use of unauthorized assistance will be treated as a violation of PC's Honor Code. If you are unsure of what resources are allowed, please ask. Please note that all text longer than 7 words taken from ANY other source must be placed in quotations and cited. Also, summarizing ANY other source must also be cited. Using ANY other source and showing work to be your own is a violation of plagiarism and the honor code.

Let's make sure we feel good about BADM 371 material.

All open notes/internet/R4DS/etc., \textbf{but all work must be your own}.

Use the starwars data (dplyr package) to answer/do:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How many individuals have no missing data?\\
\item
  Which variables have the most missing data?
\item
  Who is the tallest individual? Shortest?
\item
  How many homeworlds are there?
\item
  Which homeworld has the most individuals? Fewest?
\item
  What is the average \# of individuals per homeworld?
\item
  Make a plot of all individuals with mass on the x axis and height on the y axis.
\item
  Put a best fit line on this plot.
\item
  Who is the biggest outlier in this data set?
\item
  Calculate BMI for all these individuals. What is the average BMI for all individuals?
\item
  Which homeworlds have the greatest percentage of individuals with BMI's greater than the average for each homework? Make sure you are clear about what you do with missing data.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Choose some real data. Explain the data, why it's interesting and use some summary statistics (in line code) to describe this data.
\item
  Use a code chunk to explore it further -- missing data by variable? Interesting stuff?
\item
  Explore your data further making sure you do use each of these:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  headers
\item
  ordered lists
\item
  links
\item
  an image
\item
  a table
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Make multiple, correctly-sized plots on a single row (for example):
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{102_rmarkdown_files/figure-latex/figures-side-1} \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{102_rmarkdown_files/figure-latex/figures-side-2}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item
  Using a well-formatted code chunk answer this question: Which homeworlds have the greatest percentage of individuals with BMI's greater than the average for each homework? Make sure you are clear about what you do with missing data.
\item
  Something else neat with your data that shows your Rmarkdown skills and why your dataset is of interest.
