<p>This project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own
choosing. <strong>Please make sure I am ok with your choice.</strong> The dataset may already exist,
or you may collect your own data using a
survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your interests
or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for
you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and
beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-1" class="section level2" number="11.3">

<span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that
you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily accessible and large
enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset must have at least 50
observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me
first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical
variables, and continuous numerical variables.</p>
<p>All analyses must be done in RStudio. If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that
we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into RStudio as this
can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.</p>
<p><em>Reusing datasets from class:</em> Do not reuse datasets used in examples / homework in the
class.</p>

<p>This is a draft of the introduction section of your project as well as a
data analysis plan and your dataset. Each section should be no more than 1
page (excluding figures). You can check a print preview to confirm length.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your write up and all analysis including visuals must be done using R Markdown.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">11.4.1.1</span> Section 1 - Introduction:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#section-1---introduction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The introduction should introduce your general research
question and your data (where it came from, how it was collected, what
are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-2---data-analysis-plan" class="section level4" number="11.4.1.2">

</h4>
<p>The data analysis plan should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The outcome (dependent, response, Y) and predictor (independent, explanatory, X)
variables you will use to answer your question.</li>
<li>The comparison groups you will use, if applicable.</li>
<li>Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and
visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.
(You can add to these later as you work on your project..)</li>
<li>The statistical method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s).
(You can update these later as you work on your project.)</li>
<li>Ideally you will use at least two out of these options: tree methods, linear regression,
and classification (like logistic regression).</li>
<li>What results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your
hypothesized answer?</li>

and included.</p>

<p>After providing the description of your dataset and research question in the
introduction use the remainder of your write up to showcase how you have arrived at
an answer / answers to your question using any techniques we have learned in this
class (and some beyond, if you’re feeling adventurous). The goal is not to do an exhaustive
data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have
learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at
asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that
you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and
presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research
questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned.
Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count.</p>
<p>Your write up must also include a one to two page conclusion and discussion.
This will require a summary of what you have learned about your research
question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. Also
critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis.
Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and
appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here. A
paragraph on what you would do differently if you were able to start over
with the project or what you would do next if you were going to continue
work on the project should also be included.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is very open ended. You should create some kind of compelling
visualization(s) of this data in R.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use, but sticking to packages we learned in class (ISLR and R4DS)
is required. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high quality
visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality
visualizations.</p>
<p>Before you finalize your write up, make sure your chunks are turned off
with <code>echo = FALSE</code>. <strong>Exception:</strong> If you want to
highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcomed to show
that portion. [See below: I will also want a copy of the raw .Rmd file not just the html output.]</p>
<p>You can add sections as you see fit to the project but make sure
you have a section called Introduction at the beginning and a section called
Conclusion at the end. The rest is up to you!</p>

</h4>
<p>10 minutes maximum.</p>
<p>You can use any software you like for your final presentation, including R Markdown
to create your slides. There isn’t a limit to how many slides you can use, just a
time limit (10 minutes total). Perhaps try <code>ioslides</code> or <code>beamer</code>. Your presentation
should not just be an account of everything you
tried (“then we did this, then we did this, etc.”), instead it should convey what
choices you made, and why, and what you found.</p>

<ul>
<li>RMarkdown file (formatted to clearly present all of your code and results)</li>
<li>HTML file</li>
<li>Dataset(s) (in csv or RData format, in a <code>/data</code> folder)</li>
<li>Presentation (if using Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides, export to PDF and put in repo, in a <code>/presentation</code> folder)</li>
</ul>
<p>Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make
sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formated.</p>

<p>Grading of the project will take into account the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy
of data to those questions?</li>
<li>Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?</li>
<li>Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation,
writing, and explanations?</li>
<li>Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the
limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into
the planning and implementation of the project?</li>
</ul>
<p>A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>90%-100% - Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical
concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in
the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.</li>
<li>80%-89% - Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together
an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates
most results clearly to others.</li>
<li>70%-79% - Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several
areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication
of results is sometimes unclear.</li>
<li>60%-69% - Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding
of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication
of results is unclear.</li>
<li>Below 60% - Student is not making a sufficient effort.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Late penalty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Late, but within 24 hours of due date/time: -20% (only applies to written portion, there is no option to do your presentation later)</li>
<li>Any later: no credit</li>
