Your resource for this is ISLR Chapter 8: Tree-Based Methods.


Make sure you can exlain the terms/ideas/figures below **outloud**, in your own words, so that they make sense both to you and to someone else (me?). Actually practice exlaining the terms/ideas/figures **outloud** until your answers make sense:

- Regression vs. classification trees
- Understand Figure 8.1, Figure 8.2, Algorithm 8.1, Figure 8.3, Figure 8.4, Figure 8.5, Figure 8.6, Figure 8.7
- Bea ble to explain the='s and -'s of trees (see section 8.1.4)
- Understand "combining a large number of trees
can often result in dramatic improvements in prediction accuracy, at the expense of some loss in interpretation."
- top-down, greedy approach (aka recursive binary splitting)
- tree pruning and subtrees
- cost complexity pruning (aka weakest link pruning)
- bagging
- random forests
- boosting
- Bayesian additive regression trees
