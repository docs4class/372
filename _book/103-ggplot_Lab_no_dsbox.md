# Lab 2 -- ggplot without `dsbox`

## Excercises using the data sets `mpg` or `diamonds`

1. Create these figures using the data sets `mpg` or `diamonds` as needed:

## palmerpenguins

`palmerpenguins` is a realtively new package on CRAN, so you can install it from CRAN instead of Github.

Install it like a normal package.  After successful installation, you can find out that there are two datasets attached with the package â€“ penguins and penguins_raw. You can check out their help page (?penguins_raw and ?penguins_raw) to understand more about respective datasets.

1. Please make a well-labeled, meangingful plot that show how many missing variables there are for each variable in the dataset. Your results shoud look something like this:

2. Make a plot showing a count of penguins of each species.

3. Create a plot that illustrates the relationship between flipper_length_mm and body_mass_g with respect to each species.

4. Create a plot that illustrates the relationship between flipper_length_mm and body_mass_g with respect to each species for each island.

5.  Create a few plots of your own using new/interesting geoms and make sure the plots have meangiful, imprmfative labels, too.  For possible examples:
